# SmartInCampusCarParkingSystem

This Smart Parking system is built to provide a convenient and safety environment to users. It can provide users with real-time parking information using a mobile application
and also display the information to users at the main entrance of the parking area. With this service provided, users can plan their journey before leaving for campus and save
their time searching around the parking area just to look for an empty parking slot.
